Description: The `ITR` package provides tools to construct individualized 
treatment regimes using advanced statistical methodologies, including Instrumental Variable Outcome Weighted Learning (IV-OWL) 
and standard Outcome Weighted Learning (OWL). It facilitates the development of personalized treatment strategies 
by leveraging support vector machine (SVM) models and incorporating instrumental variables to address confounding. 
Designed for precision medicine and decision-making in healthcare, this package offers flexible modeling options and comprehensive evaluation of treatment regimes.
