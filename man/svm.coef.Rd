\title{Extract Coefficients and Slope from an SVM Model}
\usage{
svm.coef(mod, type = c("line", "slope"))
}
\arguments{
\item{mod}{A fitted SVM model object (e.g., from the \code{e1071} package).}

\item{type}{A character string indicating the type of output.
\code{"line"} returns the coefficients and intercept as a vector.
\code{"slope"} returns the slope of the decision boundary, normalized by the coefficient of \code{x2}.
Default is \code{"line"}.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing either:
\itemize{
\item The coefficients and intercept (\code{type = "line"})
\item The slope and intercept in terms of \code{x2} (\code{type = "slope"})
}
}
\description{
This function extracts the coefficients and intercept from a fitted SVM model
and optionally calculates the slope for a linear decision boundary.
}
\examples{
# Example with a dummy SVM model
# Note: Replace with a real fitted SVM model
# svm_model <- e1071::svm(Y ~ ., data = dat, kernel = "linear")
# coef <- svm.coef(svm_model, type = "line")
# slope <- svm.coef(svm_model, type = "slope")
}
